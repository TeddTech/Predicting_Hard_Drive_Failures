# Predicting_Hard_Drive_Failures

In this repository I build model to predict hard drive failures using S.M.A.R.T metrics and a methodology that can efficiently predict hard drive failures will allow for preventative maintenance of hard drives. This will provide information on which hard drives to give appropriate treatment to before they fail. Emphasis on efficiently. A model that can detect all hard drive failures but falsely predicts healthy hard drives as failures is not practical if the amount of false positives are way bigger that true positives. [See analysis](https://github.com/TeddTech/Predicting_Hard_Drive_Failures/blob/master/Data_Science_Case_Study_-_Hard_Drives.ipynb).
